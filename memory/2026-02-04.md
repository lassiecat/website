# 2026-02-04 - Recovery & Auto-Systems Day

## Morning - API Crisis

### NonKYC API Broken
- All API keys returning HTML/302 redirect instead of JSON
- Tried 3 different API keys (all same issue)
- NonKYC API appears to be broken or changed authentication
- Bot switched to monitoring-only mode

### API Keys Tested
1. `c677d4108806428c97a89a0e31597029` (original - expired)
2. `835298a6bfc74cbe96afb876652ccefe` (regenerated - still broken)
3. `8942def69c5c4211078ddfe9c08067d5` (latest - still broken)

### NonKYC API Discovery
- Working URL: `https://www.nonkyc.io/api/v1`
- Returns 302 redirect to login page
- API key validated but endpoints return HTML
- NonKYC support contact recommended

## Auto-Fix System Created

### Alert-First Problem Solver
Location: `/Users/maxwell/.openclaw/workspace/auto-fix/`

**How It Works:**
1. Detects problems (gateway, bot, API)
2. Sends Telegram alert FIRST
3. Asks for approval (YES/NO/SKIP)
4. Only fixes with user approval

**Components:**
- `detect_alert.py` - Detection + alerting
- `problems.json` - Known problems log

**Commands:**
```bash
python3 /Users/maxwell/.openclaw/workspace/auto-fix/detect_alert.py  # Run detection
